# PAF tools

A meta tool has been created in order to provide tools that take care of some more or less tedious tasks often needed when working with PAF. This tool has been designed to be intuitive and as much self-explained as possible. A helpful feature of this tool is the (under development) autocomplete when you press ```<tab>``` key in a bash terminal so feel free to use it. The PAF tools are automatically built with PAF. To use them you need to have PAF configured as usual.

You can see all the tools installed if you execute the command *```paf```* without parameters:

```sh
$ paf                                
PROOF Analysis Framework tools command
	paf - PROOF Analysis Framework (PAF) tools launcher


USAGE
	paf [--help] <tool> [tool_parameters]
	paf <tool> --help


	<tool> can take any of the following values:
	* addhistogram (ah) - Adds a histogram to a selector 
	* createselector (cs) - Creates the skeleton of a selector 
	* inspecttree (it) - Prints the tree contents in a ROOT file 
	* reset - Resets the PAF environment by closing any session that might be opened and deleting any file created 


	'paf <tool> --help' will show more detailed help on each tool
```

As shown in the last like adding ```-h``` or ```--help``` after any of the tools a detailed help for that tool is printed. Short names may be used (shown inside brackets in the help text) for some of the tools.


## PAF::InspectTree
It provides information about the contents of a ROOT file. It can show the trees inside the ROOT file, the branches inside those trees, the type per each branch, the description given by the creator of the file or a snippet of code to use directly in one analysis.

```sh
$ paf inspecttree --help
TOOL
	inspecttree - Prints the tree contents in a ROOT file


USAGE
	paf inspecttree|it [-t | --tree] [-b | --branch] [-s | --snippet] root_filename


PARAMETERS
	"-h | --help" to show command help.
	"-b | --branch branchname" to retrieve information about specified branch.
	"-t | --tree treename"  to retrieve information about specified tree.
	"-s | --snippet" to show a code snippet for each variable.
	 root_filename: ROOT file name (Mandatory)
```

Here is an output example:
```sh
$ paf inspecttree -b T_Gen* -t Tree /path/to/files/Tree_ZJets_Madgraph_0.root
Type: vector<int> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_PID
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Px
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Py
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Pz
(...)
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Py
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Pz
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Energy
```

## PAF::CreateSelector
This tool creates the a skeleton of a selector. It may be used as the first step to develop an analysis. The selector created includes the hooks needed for some other tools to work properly.
```sh
$ paf createselector 
TOOL
	createselector - Creates the skeleton of a selector


USAGE
	paf createselector|cs selector_name


PARAMETERS
	selector_name: Name of the selector (mandatory)
```

## PAF::AddHisto
Including a new histogram to be filled in an analysis is a very common task. This tool is able to add in a selector all the code needed for that, provided the selector has the appropiate hooks. It is a good idea to start with a selector created with the ```createselector``` PAF tool.
```sh
$ paf addhistogram --help
TOOL
	addhistogram - Adds a histogram to a selector


USAGE
	paf addhistogram|ah [--help] [selectorname F|D hname [htitle] nbins xmin xmax]


PARAMETERS
	"--help": Show this help
	"selectorname": Name of the selector to be used
	"F|D" type of histogram [TH1F, TH2F]
	"hname": histogram name
	"htitle": histogram title. If skipped it will take the same value as hname
	"nbins": number of bins
	"xmin": minimum value of the x axis
	"xmax": maximum value of the x axis

	If any of the parameters is not present, it will be asked interactively
```

Those parameters not provided to the tool will be asked manually in the terminal.

## PAF::Reset
When ROOT and PAF are working, they automatically generate several files and folders. These files control parts of the execution and are usefull to speed subsequent PAF executions. Sometimes, they have to be cleaned up to start with a fresh envrionment. This tools (under revision) provides a mean to do that. 

```sh
$ paf reset --help
TOOL
	reset - Resets the PAF environment by closing any session that might be opened and deleting any file created


USAGE
	paf reset [-a | --aggresive]


PARAMETERS
	"-a | --aggresive" Aggressive cleaning of files in the packages not in the official list. If this is not specified the Makefile and the PROOF-INFO directory are left untouched. Note that unless these files already exist, they are created by PAF.
```
